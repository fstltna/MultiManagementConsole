You will need to run cpan and install these modules like this:

cd /home/mtowner/MultiManagementConsole
./installdeps

Run "mcmc". If you need to change any settings after this, edit "~/.mcmcrc" and make the desired changes. This can be done within mcmc itself.

You also need to have my Multicraft Startup Script and Multicraft Backup Script installed.

I then suggest you add this directory (MultiManagementConsole) into your path, so that you can just run "git pull" to upgrade to the latest version of mcmc as updates come out.
